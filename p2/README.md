## Game planning
*Player A and Player B randomly “throw” either Rock, Paper or Scissors.
    *Create three item array with the different "throw options"
    *Create variables for each player
    *Use 'rand' function to generate a number between 0 and 2 to pick one of the outcomes. This simulates two people choosing one of the "throws"
    *Use this randomly generated number as the index to select one of the values of the "throw" array and assign player A to that value.
    *Repeat above step for Player B
*Write "if else" statements to compare the possible outcomes of the "throws". These "if else" statements set the conditions for what "throws" win and what "throws" loose. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. It is a tie if both players get/choose the same "throw".
